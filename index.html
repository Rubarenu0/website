                        <p>The first fixed photograph was produced by Joseph Niépce in 1827 and was 
                            originally referred to as a Heliograph due to the long period of exposure 
                            to the sun required to produce the image. Niépce collaborated with Louis 
                            Daguerre to produce the Daguerreotype which was the result of their experiments 
                            with light-sensitive paper. The Daguerreotype became a popular method of photography; 
                            however, because it was expensive to produce and it was not possible to create multiple 
                            images, it was used mainly for portraiture. In the 1830s William Henry Fox Talbot developed 
                            the more versatile Calotype, which allowed for the production of multiple prints through the 
                            development of a negative image.The first fixed photograph was produced by Joseph Niépce in 1827 and was
